### For Loop
# for i in range(10):
#     print(i) ## Prints 0 to 9
#
# for i in range(1,10):
#     print(i) ## Prints 1 to 9

# l = ['1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th', '5th']
# for i in range (len(l)):
#     print(l[i])
# for i in l:
#     print(i)

# for i in range(0, 100, 10):
#     print(i)

# t = ('1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th')
# for x in t:
#     print(x)

# s = 'This is a string'
# for x in s:
#     print(x)

### While Loop
# i = 1
# while i < 10:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1

# l = ['1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th', '5th']
# i = 0
# while i < len(l):
#     print(l[i])
#     i += 1


### For Loop with Else
# l = ['1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th', '5th']
# for x in l:
#     print(x)
# else:
#     print('List exhausted')


### Break Statement
# for i in range(10):
#     if i == 7:
#         break
#     print(i)


### Continue Statement
# for i in range(10):
#     if i == 7:
#         continue
#     print(i)



### Pass Statement
# for i in range(10):
#     pass ## 5 star statement - does nothing
